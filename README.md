<h1>My first mini-project</h1>

<h2>Who am I and why I am applying for this program?</h2>

<p>My name is Sidrak Samuel. I'm 21 years old and originally from Pakistan. I have lived in Malaysia for five years. I live with my four siblings, mom and dad.
As I have mentioned before in my application, I was in ninth grade in my home country of Pakistan but I had to quit my studies because my family
had to move out of the country. Unfortunately I could not complete my high school studies. I did not get a chance to continue my studies after moving to Malaysia.
I believe that education is the most important key to being successful in life. Since I did not get the opportunity to complete my studies, I feel that this is a
great chance for me to learn. It is a great opportunity that your company is providing. The skills that I can learn will help me to apply to get a job no matter where I
would live.
I would very much appreciate the chance to learn these skills and be able to secure my future.
Thank you!
